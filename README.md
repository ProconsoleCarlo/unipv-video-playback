This project was the team project developed for the university course [Fondamenti di informatica II](http://www-3.unipv.it/ingserv//didattica/schedacorso1314.php?cod=502476&spec=0), in the time between 24/04/2014 and 20/05/2014.

The purpose was to create a GUI with the following features:
- reproduce a single video;
- reproduce a playlist of videos;
- allow to create a playlist.

The documentation [BozzaStoriaUtente.jpg](./BozzaStoriaUtente.jpg) shows the two iterations (including demos with professor) we did to achieve the project.

It was written with Java 7, but it still works with Java 17.

It uses the [Java Media Framework library](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/java-media-framework.html) to reproduce videos: this library was discontinued in 2003 and that is the big problem nowadays.
The library was compiled for 32bit, and it supported only few codecs. To 
The big problem is that it is no more able to reproduce videos due to the library we used that is no more supported neither configurable with jffmpeg codecs.
